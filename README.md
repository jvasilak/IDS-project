Stage 1 Notes:
The raw data is too big to add to Github and I have not been able to get it to work with Git lfs yet. If you need to see it, the latest version of the data can be found at https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwikivoyage/latest/enwikivoyage-latest-pages-meta-current.xml.bz2. The version used to train the model was the latest on 4/21/23.

Final Version Notes:
There are two ways to run the code: you can use either main.py or gui.py. main.py runs it with a command line interface of the kind we have been using throughout the semester, while gui.py runs it with a tkinter-based gui. Both files are located in the PythonFiles folder. Code in the src folder is not used at all in our final submission.

The model file is also too big to add to Github, similar to the raw data, so we have decided to include a link to a huggingface repository: https://huggingface.co/jvasilak/IDS-project/tree/main
Please follow the instructions in that repo's readme to download and move the file as needed to run the code in this repository.
